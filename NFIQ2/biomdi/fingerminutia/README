This software was developed at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) by employees of the Federal Government in the course
of their official duties. Pursuant to title 17 Section 105 of the
United States Code, this software is not subject to copyright protection
and is in the public domain. NIST assumes no responsibility  whatsoever for
its use by other parties, and makes no guarantees, expressed or implied,
about its quality, reliability, or any other characteristic.

This distributions contains the source for the Finger Minutiae Record libraries
and utility programs. The FMR library can process INCITS M1 378, and
ISO 19794-2 (standard and compact) format records.

Gnu make is required to build and install this distribution.

Installation steps:
	make
	make install

The top-level Makefile can be changed to specify the installation directories
for the binaries, libraries, and man pages. The make variables are 
INCPATH, LIBPATH, BINPATH, and MANPATH.

Two of the utility programs, fmr2an2k and an2k2fmr, require that the NIST
NBIS tools suite be installed (the liban2k library specifically). If you don't
have that library, remove the fmr2an2k and an2k2fmr entries from the SUBDIRS
line in the src/Makefile file.

The FMR plotting program requires the GD graphics library, available at
http://www.libgd.org/ and distributed in many ported packages. 
Building of fmrplot is disabled by default.  If you want the FMR plotting
program to be built, add 'fmrplot' to the 'SUBDIRS' line in the src/Makefile.
If you build the AN2K programs, or the plotting program, be sure to modify
the COMMONINCOPT and COMMONLIBOPT definitions in src/common.mk.

On some systems (Linux, for example), it may be required to reload the 
dynamic linker cache after installation by running the 'ldconfig' command.
