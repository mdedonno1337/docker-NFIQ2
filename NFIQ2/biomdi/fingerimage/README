This distribution contains the source for the Finger Image library and utility
programs. Currently, records conforming to the ANSI-INCITS 381-2004 and
ISO/IEC 19794-4:2004 standards are processed.

Gnu make is required to build and install this distribution.

Installation steps:
	make
	make install

The top-level Makefile can be changed to specify the installation directories
for the binaries, libraries, and man pages. The make variables are 
INCPATH, LIBPATH, BINPATH, and MANPATH.

On some systems (Linux, for example), it may be required to reload the 
dynamic linker cache after installation by running the 'ldconfig' command.

'make clean' will remove the local build directories and intermediate files.
