This README document shows how to compile the NFIQ2 operational kit
and its dependencies manually.

More information about the whole process may be found in the NFIQ2 framework README.

1. Compilation of OpenCV
------------------------

In order to compile OpenCV, cmake has to be installed.
Before compilation it may be necessary to remove the Perforce write-protection of the folders libOpenCV and OpenCV.

- Change to directory libOpenCV
- cmake -D CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=make ../OpenCV/
- make opencv_core opencv_ts opencv_imgproc opencv_highgui opencv_flann opencv_features2d opencv_calib3d opencv_ml opencv_video opencv_objdetect opencv_contrib opencv_nonfree opencv_gpu opencv_photo opencv_stitching opencv_videostab

Created libraries are then stored in libOpenCV/bin and libOpenCV/lib.
Libraries stored to libOpenCV/bin will be needed for execution of NFIQ2. So, copy them to the execution folder.

OpenCV DLLs for MSVC9 and MSVC10 will be compiled during execution the according solution (see step 2).
They will be stored to OpenCV/projects/<compiler>/bin/<Release|Debug>.

Needed OpenCV libraries are:
- opencv_core
- opencv_imgproc
- opencv_ml

2. Compilation of NFIQ2 operational kit
---------------------------------------

Execute Makefile in folder NFIQ2 ("make"). 

This will compile the NFIQ2 operational kit.

Further dependencies for the NFIQ2 (like libFRXFLL, biomdi) will be
automatically compiled.

Executables will be stored in bin folder.
libbiomdi.dll(.so), libfmr.dll(.so), and libbiomeval.dll(.so) need to be copied to the bin directory when executing NFIQ2.

If Microsoft Visual Studio shall be used to compile the framework, the according solution file has to be executed.

When using MSVC compilers, the libbiomdi und libfmr projects are compiled as static libraries and, hence, no further DLLS must be used.
